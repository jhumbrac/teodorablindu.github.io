			<h1>Day 26: Sebastian</h1>
			<p>27 February, 2015 in Brussels</p>
			<h3>26 years old and from Belgium but currently living in London</h3>
			<h3>Speaks English and French<h3>
			<h2>Describe the meeting circumstance<h2>
			<h3>My friend introduced me to Sebastian. As we were sitting in a cafe waiting for him, the meeting was preplanned in a way so I wanted to try an experiment. I brainstormed different introductory first liners because often times we introduce ourselves with a hello, my name is, how are you and etc other common phrases. When Sebastian arrived, I was inspired by his jacket and introduced myself as "Hi, I'm Teodora. Nice jacket, can I have it?” He nervously laughed and said “Erm thanks, you can try it on I guess.” He proceeded to sit down, take off his jacket, place it on a chair and change the topic.</h3>
			<h2>What I learned</h2>
			<h3>First liners are important. After explaining to him my project, Sebastian admitted thinking that I was bizarre at first. Then he warmed up and was very nice, as noted in the photo when he even let me borrow the jacket for the photo.</h3>

		<h1>Hi! I'm Teodora Blindu, a graphic designer with a tendency of filling up my free time with side projects.</h1>

		<p>100 new ___ is a personal project I started to explore creativity in a way that works for me: doing a creative action every day for 100 days. I've found that the on and off intense 100 days routine has really worked for me. The idea of my 100 days experiment was inspired by <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdesignobserver.com%2Ffeature%2Ffive-years-of-100-days%2F24678&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGZjeDsnVucQPnVFWYfUH354-6qow">Michael Bierut's workshop</a> for the graduate graphic design students and Yale School of Art.</p>

		<p>Here are some of the 100 days projects I have completed or am in the process of completing.</p>

		<p><b>100 NEW PEOPLE</b></p>
		<p>From February 2 to May 12, 2015 I met one new person every day and recorded the moment by taking a photo with them. Throughout the course of the project I traveled to 10 different cities on two continents, meeting a very interesting group of people that kept me inspired every day. You can see the people I have met and their stories here.</p>

		<h2>100 NEW EXPERIENCES</h2>
		<p>Over the course of July, August and September I have the unique opportunity of living in different cities around Europe while freelancing. To document the experience from a critical design perspective, I will try something new every day and film it.</p>
