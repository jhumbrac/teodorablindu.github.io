		<h1>Hi! I'm Teodora Blindu, a graphic designer with a tendency of filling up my free time with side projects.</h1>
		<p>100 new ___ is a personal project I started to explore creativity in a way that works for me: doing a creative action every day for 100 days. I’ve found that the on and off intense 100 days routine has really worked for me. The idea of my 100 days experiment was inspired by <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdesignobserver.com%2Ffeature%2Ffive-years-of-100-days%2F24678&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGZjeDsnVucQPnVFWYfUH354-6qow">Michael Bierut’s workshop</a> for the graduate graphic design students and Yale School of Art.</p>
